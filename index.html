                    <h1>BIOL 243: Human Anatomy & Physiology</h1>
                    <p class="lead">
                        This course explores how the human body is organized and how it maintains balance
                        through chemical, cellular, and tissue-level processes. The first four chapters
                        introduce the foundation of anatomy and physiology.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead">
                        Today you will be reviewing four key topics from Chapters 1 through 4: 
                        Homeostasis, the pH scale, Cell Structure, and the Four Different Types of Tissues. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Chapter 1 Homeostasis</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 1 focuses on how the body maintains a stable internal environment.
                    You will learn about feedback systems, control centers, receptors, and effectors
                    that work together to keep conditions like temperature and blood pressure in balance.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 2 Chemistry of Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 2 explains the chemical building blocks of the body — atoms, molecules,
                    and compounds — and how water, pH, and biochemical reactions support life.
                    You will explore acids, bases, and buffers and why the pH scale is important in biology.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 3 The Cellular Level</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 3 covers the structure and function of the cell, including organelles,
                    membranes, and how substances move in and out through diffusion, osmosis,
                    and active transport. You will see how cells carry out essential processes to sustain life.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 4 Tissues</h2>
                <p>
                Chapter 4 introduces the four main tissue types — epithelial, connective, muscle,
                and nervous tissue. You will study how these specialized groups of cells work together
                to form organs and body systems.
                </p>

                <h2>Why These Chapters Matter</h2>
                <p>
                    Together, Chapters 1 through 4 lay the foundation for understanding how the human body
                    works as a complete, coordinated system. Mastering these basics prepares you for
                    deeper study of organ systems, physiology, and medical applications in later chapters.
