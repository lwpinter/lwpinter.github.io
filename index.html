                <h1>BIOL 243: Human Anatomy & Physiology</h1>
                <p class="lead">
                    This course explores how the human body is organized and how it maintains balance
                    through chemical, cellular, and tissue-level processes. The first four chapters
                    introduce the foundation of anatomy and physiology.

            <section>
                <h2>Chapter 1 Homeostasis</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 1 focuses on how the body maintains a stable internal environment.
                    You’ll learn about feedback systems, control centers, receptors, and effectors
                    that work together to keep conditions like temperature and blood pressure in balance.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 2 Chemistry of Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 2 explains the chemical building blocks of the body — atoms, molecules,
                    and compounds — and how water, pH, and biochemical reactions support life.
                    You’ll explore acids, bases, and buffers and why the pH scale is important in biology.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 3 The Cellular Level</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 3 covers the structure and function of the cell, including organelles,
                    membranes, and how substances move in and out through diffusion, osmosis,
                    and active transport. You’ll see how cells carry out essential processes to sustain life.
                </p>

                <h2>Chapter 4 Tissues</h2>
                <p>
                    Chapter 4 introduces the four main tissue types — epithelial, connective, muscle,
                    and nervous tissue. You’ll study how these specialized groups of cells work together
                    to form organs and body systems.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Why These Chapters Matter</h2>
                <p>
                    Together, Chapters 1 – 4 lay the foundation for understanding how the human body
                    works as a complete, coordinated system. Mastering these basics prepares you for
                    deeper study of organ systems, physiology, and medical applications in later chapters.
